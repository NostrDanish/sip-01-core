/**
 * Shared LOW-LEVEL text matching toolkit (stop words, punctuation
 * normalization, plural folding, word/phrase matching, coverage).
 *
 * NEW CODE belongs one level up: queryParser.ts (raw query → structured
 * AST: terms, phrases, AND/OR/NOT, filters) and queryEngine.ts (the
 * authoritative evaluator). The legacy helpers below are preserved — the
 * engine's plain-query gate reuses these exact semantics, and resultRank
 * still runs its 50/50 title/body coverage on them.
 *
 * What this module has always done (all preserved):
 *
 *   - punctuation-insensitive: "C++" matches "c", "state-of-the-art"
 *     matches "state of the art";
 *   - stop-word tolerant: "the / a / of / …" don't filter results out when
 *     the query also carries meaningful words (they still count when the
 *     query is ONLY stop words, e.g. "the who");
 *   - naive plural folding: a term also matches its de-pluralized form
 *     ("wallets" matches "wallet", "queries" matches "query");
 *   - NIP-50 operator tokens (containing ':') never match literally —
 *     they're relay-side directives (site:, lang:, after:, …);
 *   - phrase-aware: a full-phrase substring match scores highest;
 *   - gutting guard: when stop-word removal shrinks a multi-word query to a
 *     single keyword ("how to build" → "build"), a document must ALSO match
 *     a second query word or the phrase itself — otherwise every page
 *     containing "build" (or "builder", via substring) would rank for it.
 *     This was the "it only searched one word" bug.
