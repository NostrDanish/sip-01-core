/**
 * Engine Profile — Dsearch's explicit application identity.
 *
 * One core, many independently branded engines: the search pipeline,
 * providers, query parser, and SIP-01 index protocol stay shared protocol
 * engineering; this file is the product surface. Brand strings must live
 * here — not scattered through components.
 *
 * Dsearch is an independent search-engine project: the ecosystem hub
 * (Network / Build / Protocol / Community) and every provider stay ON —
 * unlike community-engine profiles, which trim the surface down.
 *
 * Nothing in this file is a secret. API keys stay in the Cloudflare worker
 * environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY` — legacy alias `AI_API_KEY` — and
 * `BRAVE_API_KEY`) and never ship in the bundle.
