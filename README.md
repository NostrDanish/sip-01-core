# SIP-01-core

**The reusable reference implementation of the SIP-01 Search Index Protocol —
engine, contracts, providers, and AI layer that any search engine can build on.**

> **Repository roles — read this first:**
>
> | Repo | Role |
> |---|---|
> | [`NostrDanish/SIP-01`](https://github.com/NostrDanish/SIP-01) | **The protocol** — canonical specification, wire format, test vectors |
> | **`NostrDanish/sip-01-core` (this repo)** | **The core software** — protocol reference implementation + reusable search-engine layer |
> | `NostrDanish/Dsearch`, `Savedd`, … | **Applications** — products built on the core |
>
> Architecture: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) · Layer contracts:
> [`PACKAGE_BOUNDARIES.md`](PACKAGE_BOUNDARIES.md) · Extraction status:
> [`docs/EXTRACTION-MAP.md`](docs/EXTRACTION-MAP.md)
>
> **Protocol version ≠ software version.** The SIP-01 wire format (`v: "1"`) is
> frozen except through the spec; this core can improve independently.
>
> **Licensing note:** per-layer license terms (and what they mean for
> closed-source derivatives) are a pending project decision being settled
> before ecosystem publication. Until a LICENSE file exists per layer, no
> reuse rights are granted by default.

This repository currently also contains the **Dsearch application** — the
flagship engine — as its in-tree reference app (being isolated into an
application layer; see the extraction map). Everything below the next divider
documents that application.

# Dsearch (the reference application)

**The community-driven search engine. Powered by Nostr, owned by no one.**

Dsearch is the **decentralized search engine built by its users** — and the home of an open
search-infrastructure ecosystem. One shared index on Nostr, built by everyone who searches,
crawls, indexes, or runs a relay. No company owns the crawler, the index, the relay network,
or this interface.

**Live:** [dsearch.com](https://dsearch.com)

## Brand

All brand assets live in [`public/brand/`](public/brand/):

| File | What |
|------|------|
| [`icon.svg`](public/brand/icon.svg) | **The master mark** — vector, scales to any size |
| [`logo.svg`](public/brand/logo.svg) | Horizontal lockup — mark + wordmark + tagline (auto light/dark) |
| [`pwa-icon.png`](public/brand/pwa-icon.png) | **PWA / app icon** — 1024×1024 dark-tile mark (install, home screen, apple-touch) |
| [`icon-1024.png`](public/brand/icon-1024.png) | Raster icon 1024×1024 (same mark, avatars / app stores) |
| [`logo-1024.png`](public/brand/logo-1024.png) | Raster lockup 1024×1024 |
| [`logo-lockup.jpg`](public/brand/logo-lockup.jpg) | Dark-tile lockup (JPEG) |
| [`favicon.svg`](public/favicon.svg) | Browser tab icon (simplified for 16–32px) |
| [`og.jpg`](public/og.jpg) | Social link preview card |

The mark: a magnifying glass revealing a node network shaped like the letter
**D** — search (the glass) over the decentralized index (the constellation).
Teal `#17a398` with deep navy `#1b3a7a` accent nodes. In the app, every teal
element renders in `currentColor`, so the logo follows the active theme and
the user's accent color (`src/components/LogoMark.tsx`).

## The Ecosystem

Dsearch is the flagship engine of a modular stack. Every layer is open, separable, and
runnable by anyone:

**Lineage:** Dsearch consolidates several iterations of community search work —
**0xSearchstr** (the original aggregator) → **UNCAGED Engine** (the minimal template) →
**Presearchstr** (the community fork) → **Dsearch** (the independent ecosystem).
It is not a rebrand of any single predecessor: it's where the stack becomes one coherent project.

**Federation:** Dsearch and [0xSearchstr](https://github.com/NostrDanish/0xSearchstr) share one
index. Same kinds, same tags, different signers. A search on either app warms the index for both.

## What You Can Do Here

- **Search** — the engine: SIP-01 community index first, then 15 parallel providers (Nostr NIP-50,
  SearXNG, DuckDuckGo, Brave BYOK, Hacker News, wiki, git, Tor…). Keyword staking with your Nostr key.
- **Network** (`/network`) — live view: index relays, crawler heartbeats, latest observations.
- **Build** (`/build`) — run a crawler (Crawlstr), an indexer (Indexstr), or a SIP relay.
- **Protocol** (`/protocol`) — SIP-01 explained; SIP-02 (query layer) draft area.
- **Community** (`/community`) — every repo, every contribution path.

                        ▼
                    Display Results  →  auto-index surfaced pages (SIP-01)
                        │
                   Still nothing? → privacy-respecting fallback links
```

1. **Every source is a provider** — each returns a universal `SearchResult[]`
2. **All providers run in parallel** — results stream in as each completes
3. **The community index scores highest** — decentralized results are prioritized
4. **Auto-indexing** — every search contributes surfaced pages back as SIP-01 observations,
   signed by a per-device pseudonymous keypair (never your identity, never your query)
5. **Never empty** — fallback links to privacy-respecting engines

### Structured queries

The search bar parses real search syntax into an AST and executes it **locally and
authoritatively** — operators are never "stripped and hoped for":

```
"decentralized search"      exact phrase        site:github.com     host + subdomains
nostr AND privacy           boolean (UPPERCASE) lang:de             language
nostr NOT twitter           exclusion           tag:nostr           exact topic tag
(nostr OR bitcoin)          grouping            after:2026-01-01    date boundary
```

This engine is the reference implementation seed for the in-development **SIP-02** query-layer
specification. Full guide: [docs/SEARCH-QUERIES.md](docs/SEARCH-QUERIES.md).

### Query classification & privacy

| Input | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| `15% of 80` | Calculator instant answer — no providers run at all |
| `npub1…` / `note1…` | Nostr instant card — clearnet engines never see it |
| `name@domain.tld` | NIP-05 resolution to a profile card |
| `https://example.com` | SIP-01 index lookup — only Nostr-tier providers run |
| anything else | Full provider fan-out |

Provider skipping isn't just speed — it's privacy. The honest traffic-light indicator by the
search bar shows exactly who can see each query (Nostr relays / direct APIs / proxied engines).

### Keyword staking

Stake a keyword with your Nostr key — no tokens: sign an addressable event binding a keyword to
your link and it takes the top "Community Stake" placement on every compatible client. One stake
per keyword per npub; recency-ranked today, zap-weighting-ready by schema.

## Protocol

Everything this app writes is documented in [NIP.md](NIP.md) and the canonical
[SIP-01 spec](https://github.com/NostrDanish/SIP-01) (local copy: [docs/SIP-01.md](docs/SIP-01.md)):

- **Web document index** (`widx:*`) — SIP-01, kind 39697, per-device indexer identities
- **Search cache** (`0xsearchstr:cache:*`) — federated legacy cache, kind 30078 (frozen, read-only)
- **Term signals** (`0xsearchstr:term:*`) — hashed k-anonymity trending (never plaintext queries)
- **Community submissions** (`0xsearchstr:submit:*`) — user-curated links
- **Keyword stakes** (`0xsearchstr:stake:*`) — Nostr-native keyword placement

The `0xsearchstr:*` namespaces are the **federation contract** shared with 0xSearchstr and every
compatible fork — they are intentionally kept, not legacy accidents.

Application control-plane data (role lists, moderation labels, abuse inboxes, affiliate rules,
invite-friends config) lives in the **`dsearch:*` control plane** (`src/lib/dsearchProtocol.ts`),
rooted at the owner key — never in the shared federation namespaces. Legacy `presearchstr:*` /
`0xsearchstr.*` control data stays readable (owner-signed) until migrated. Partner referrals use
pseudonymous per-device keys (kinds 34967 / 6079, `t: dsearch-referral`).

---

## Relay Pools

Four default pools, all user-editable in Settings (hide defaults, add customs, restore):

| Pool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Index Relays** | Where the community index lives — SIP-01 observations, legacy cache, submissions, stakes |
| **Search Relays** | NIP-50 full-text Nostr search (read-only) |
| **Git Relays** | NIP-34 repos/issues/PRs for the Code tab (read-only) |
| **Wiki Relays** | NIP-54 wiki articles (read-only) |

Index and search pools also grow by **auto-discovery** (NIP-66 announcements + NIP-11
verification; the SIP-01 `uncaged_index` block earns a relay its index-pool spot).

---

## AI Answers (optional)

An optional AI answer layer synthesizes cited answers from the result evidence pack — off by
default, ephemeral, never indexed. Credential precedence: **your own key** (any
OpenAI-compatible API, Settings → AI) → **engine-provided** (operator key via the included
Cloudflare worker, `/api/ai`) → **built-in free tier** (public, rate-limited by design) →
unavailable. Nostr results are excluded from evidence unless you opt in.

---

## Self-Hosted Backend (legacy, optional)

The `backend/` directory contains the original 0xSearchstr-era self-hosted stack (Meilisearch +
Nostr/clearnet/Tor crawlers + NIP-50 relay proxy + abuse API, `docker compose up -d`).
It is superseded in practice by the SIP-01 ecosystem (Crawlstr/Indexstr + SIP relays) and kept
for operators who want it. New infrastructure work targets the SIP stack.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NostrDanish/Dsearch.git
cd Dsearch
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and search.
